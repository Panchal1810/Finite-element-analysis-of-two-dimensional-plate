# Finite-element-analysis-of-two-dimensional-plate
The displacement and stress is computed on the two-dimensional plate using Finite Element Method (plain stress condition). The discretization is carried out using three noded triangular, four noded and 8 noded  quard elements. Finally, the displacement and stress is compared with different type of elements.
